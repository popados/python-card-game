    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html

Day 4 | 2/5/2022 - Saturday -

- Forgot to do stuff. Dang, not even a week into coding and I stop for a day.

Day 5 | 2/6/2022 - Sunday -

- https://realpython.com/python-return-statement/#returning-vs-printing

    - If your function has multiple return statements and returning None is a valid option, then you should consider the explicit use of return None instead of relying on the Pythonâ€™s default behavior.


**BAD PRACTICE :**
```
counter = 0

def increment() :
global counter
counter +=1

>>>>increment()
>>>>counter
>1

```
**GOOD PRACICE :**

```

counter = 0

def increment(var) :
return counter +=1

>>> increment(counter)
> 1
>>> counter
> 0
>>> counter = incrememnt(counter)
>>> counter
> 1



```

I was reading about variables and objects in python. Cleaned up some of the scripts more.

Looking at work now. Will write more about how I started programming and self learning.
